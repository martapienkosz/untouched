# Untouched
## Alternate Realities Project by Marta Pienkosz

In 1984, a **ruthless virus ravished** a small village in the south of the Untouched world. Some residents managed to escape in time and settle in the north. Not everyone was so lucky. Most confronted **immediate death.**

Nature has **flourished** in the **abandoned space**, somewhat damaged in recent decades. The Village is currently a **nature-dominated** ruin that only the brave can visit. Rumors have reported that deadly particles are still hovering in the air.

### Description

The abandoned house is in the middle
of a wild forest.

### Process

I started my project by imagining the space I want to design and then sketching it on a piece of paper. The next step was searching Unity Assets for ones that would make my space look compelling. I have carefully examined the usefullness of found assets and started composiing the scene - first by differentiating the terrain, nextly by wrapping the ground with ivy and finally putting inside of this wildness an abandoned house.

Filling the space with ivy enhances the storytelling, it is thanks to these small elements that users can immerse into the natural wilderness and the maze of trees (I got lost in them several times!)

Abandoned furniture, often displaced and devoid of personal belongings, books or expensive electronics, create a narrative of leaving the space in a rush and with the intention of never comming back. The furniture look damaged and relatively old - it can be assumed that someone left this house in the 1980s.

How do you hint traces of a virus? I looked for appropriate assets that would indicate how the village was ravaged - such as broken chemicals or masks. Instead, I came up with the idea of mysterious green dust floating in the air around the house. It is intriguing and a bit terrifying at the same time.
