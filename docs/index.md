# Untouched
### Alternate Realities Project by Marta Pienkosz

In 1984, a **ruthless virus ravished** a small village in the south of the Untouched world. Some residents managed to escape in time and settle in the north. Not everyone was so lucky. Most confronted **immediate death.**

Nature has **flourished** in the **abandoned space**, somewhat damaged in recent decades. The Village is currently a **nature-dominated** ruin that only the brave can visit. Rumors have reported that deadly particles are still hovering in the air.

## Description

In the middle of a wild, overgrown forest there is an abandoned wooden house. The roof has long since collapsed under the weight of leaves and snow falling every season, and the ivy slowly began to claim the space once inhabited. There is no trace of lates human activity. Someone must have left this house in a hurry, knocking over some items and leaving only the heaviest pieces of furniture behind. Around the walls of the house as well as on the floor one can spot a mysterious green dust floting - is it a ravising exhibit of a new form of nature or is it the source of depicted ravage?

## Process

I started my project by imagining the space I want to design and then sketching it on a piece of paper. The next step was searching Unity Assets for ones that would make my space look compelling. I have carefully examined the usefullness of found assets and started composiing the scene - first by differentiating the terrain, nextly by wrapping the ground with ivy and finally putting inside of this wildness an abandoned house.

Filling the space with ivy enhances the storytelling, it is thanks to these small elements that users can immerse into the natural wilderness and the maze of trees (I got lost in them several times!)

Abandoned furniture, often displaced and devoid of personal belongings, books or expensive electronics, create a narrative of leaving the space in a rush and with the intention of never comming back. The furniture look damaged and relatively old - it can be assumed that someone left this house in the 1980s.

How do you hint traces of a virus? I looked for appropriate assets that would indicate how the village was ravaged - such as broken chemicals or masks. Instead, I came up with the idea of mysterious green dust floating in the air around the house. It is intriguing and a bit terrifying at the same time.

### First dylema: Lightning
I was wondering whether to insert the neon lights and slightly light up the interior of the house. At the moment, the space is a bit dark and difficult to navigate. However, it is an abandoned house and lighting elements simply do not have the right to exist in it. To improve orientation and slightly lit up the space slightly, I added more mysterious green particles that would mark the boundaries of the floor or the walls. Unfortunately, my computer takes 12 hours to bake the lightning, so the neon-like material is still stuck in my dreams.

### Second dylema: Environment 
At first, I wanted to create a slightly more mysterious and traumatic environment by setting the dusk snapshot as the skybox. However, the story narrative isn't mysterious at all, it should emphasize the stunning victory of the flourishing nature and the defeat of humanity. Paradoxically, the place should radieate with the positive energy hence the lack of dramatic nature.

### Third dylema: Trees
After building the forest I have noticed that some trees just don't encompass the lighting of the environment. I had to replace them, but the question - why - is still lingering in my mind

### Animation
Finally, I decided to add gentle animations, moving trees and the sound of the wind. At first the animations worked perfectly and [here you can see the result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t4p_XzLO4XIRld974nx0V8PtAPkWdEWu/view?usp=sharing)! Unfortunately later something went wrong and I was no longer able to add clip properties to objects (and there are 60 triples so I preferred not to do it manually). For 2 hours I had been trying various ways, by copying clips and adding to objects, modifying in the timeline, but nothing worked properly.
