I created the Zen Garden Bonsair which is filled with my favorite type of greenery. I focused on carefully selecting the colors of the objects, grass or pots to help create a coherent scenery. I also added a few stones to differentiate the relief. Unfortunately, I was unable to apply the Polybrush resources as they did not show up as an available option in the inspector.
At the beginning, it was very difficult for me to operate the camera and set the view to make 3D modeling as simple as possible. After some time, however, I got used to this system. Later I ran into a problem with gismo and exiting perspective mode. Every time I did it, I was unable to go back to the perspective mode. I had to reset the settings every time.
I find the environment modification feature exciting. Without in-depth control of lighting and sky color, the garden looked rather dull and dull. Now with the vivid orange-yellow colors of the sunset and the deep shade, the garden penetrates with a certain mystery. It's amazing how the ambient settings can change the type of narration and define the atmosphere.
I would like to know more about how to use prefabricated elements and materials. It seems to me that we discussed these topics very briefly in the class. I feel like they could easily raise the standard of our projects.
