## Untouched

In 1984, a ruthless virus ravished a small village in the south of the Untouched world. Some residents managed to escape in time and settle in the north. Not everyone was so lucky. Most confronted immediate death.

Nature has flourished in the abandoned space, somewhat damaged in recent decades. The Village is currently a nature-dominated ruin that only the brave can visit. Rumors have reported that deadly particles are still hovering in the air.
